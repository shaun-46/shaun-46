💻 Debugging code by day, fixing laptops by night
🌱 Currently watering plants and growing my skills
🎯 Aiming to replace console.logs with actual debugging

👨‍💻 About Me:
🔧 I fix laptops when I'm not breaking my own code.
🧐 Still figuring out if it's a bug or a feature.
⏳ Spending more time fixing merge conflicts than writing new features.
