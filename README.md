Hi, I'm Shaun S! 👨‍💻🚀
👾 Code Alchemist – Turning coffee into bugs since 2021 .
🎭 CSS Magician – Where flexbox & grid solve problems I didn’t know I had.
🐛 Bug Creator & Fixer – Sometimes in that order.
🤖 JavaScript Enthusiast – Writing code that works… most of the time.

💡 Fun Facts About Me:
🔹 I once spent 3 hours debugging, only to realize I missed a semicolon.
🔹 80% of my code is Googled, 10% is Stack Overflow-ed, and the last 10%? Pure luck.
🔹 My most used Git command: git commit -m "fix stuff" (no details provided).

🚀 Currently working on: Learning new tech, improving my MERN stack skills, and figuring out why my code works (or doesn’t).

📌 Life motto: “If it compiles, ship it.”
