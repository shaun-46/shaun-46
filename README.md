Sure! Here’s a fun bullet-point style version for your GitHub profile:

Hey there! 👋😄
💻 Frontend Developer & MERN Stack Explorer – Making things work (after breaking them a few times).
🎨 CSS Survivor – If it looks good and isn’t broken, I probably copied it from Stack Overflow.
🐞 Bug Whisperer – I don’t find bugs; they find me.
⚡ JavaScript Enthusiast – Writing console.log("working?") since day one.
🛠️ React Fanatic – Still pretending to fully understand useEffect().
🚀 Git Expert – By that, I mean I use git push --force way more than I should.
⏳ Procrastination Pro – Why fix it now when I can fix it in production?
📌 Motto: “If it works, don’t ask why.”
